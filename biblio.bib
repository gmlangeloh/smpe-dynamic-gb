These cryptanalysis break cryptosystems in the HFE family by solving multivariate systems of equations. In this paper we present a new and efficient attack of this cryptosystem based on fast algorithms for computing Gr{\"{o}}bner basis.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} International Association for Cryptologic Research 2017. A multivariate quadratic public-key cryptography (MQ-PKC) is one of the most promising alternatives for classical PKC after the eventual coming of a quantum computer. We propose a new MQ-signature scheme, ELSA, based on a hidden layer of quadratic equations which is an important role in dramatically reducing the secret key size and computational complexity in signing. We prove existential unforgeability of our scheme against an adaptive chosen-message attack under the hardness of the MQ-problem induced by a public key of ELSA with a specific parameter set in the random oracle model. We analyze the security of ELSA against known attacks and derive a concrete parameter based on the security analysis. Performance of ELSA on a recent Intel processor is the fastest among state-of-the-art signature schemes including classical ones and Post-Quantum ones. It takes 6.3 $\mu$s and 13.39 $\mu$s for signing and verification, respectively. Compared to Rainbow, the secret size of the new scheme has reduced by a factor of 88{\%} maintaining the same public key size.},

We also show that the problem is unary NP-hard for instances with binary tree ratio strictly larger than 2, and provide a quasi polynomial time approximation scheme (QPTAS). The approximation ratio of Greedy on general instances is shown to be between 1.5 and 25/24.},

abstract = {Tien D. Kieu, in 10 papers posted to the quant-ph section of the xxx.lanl.gov preprint archive [some of which were also published in printed journals such as Proc. Royal Soc. A 460 (2004) 1535] had claimed to have a scheme showing how, in principle, physical "quantum adiabatic systems" could be used to solve the prototypical computationally undecidable problem, Turing's "halting problem", in finite time, with success probability {\textgreater}2/3 (where this 2/3 is independent of the input halting problem). There were several errors in those papers, most which ultimately could be corrected. More seriously, we here exhibit counterexamples to a crucial step in Kieu's argument. The counterexamples are small quantum adiabatic systems in which "decoy" nonground states arise with high probability ({\textgreater}99.999{\%}). Kieu had wrongly claimed no decoy state could ever acquire occupation probability greater than 50{\%}. These counterexamples destroy Kieu's entire plan and there seems no way to correct the plan to escape them. Nevertheless, there are some important consequences salvageable from Kieu's idea: we can prove that the "halflife" of Kieu's quantum systems is uncomputably large and no fully general form of the quantum adiabatic theorem can exist that yields computable upper bounds on adiabatic convergence times (both unless Church's thesis is false so that finite time adiabatic quantum system evolution is unsimulable); and we can prove that no algorithm exists to find the ground-state energy of Kieu's class of quantum Hamiltonians and hence their long-term thermal behavior is uncomputable. {\textcopyright} 2005.},

abstract = {In this article we will discuss a mostly theoretical framework for solving zero-dimensional polynomial systems. Complexity bounds are obtained for solving such systems using a new parameter, called the last fall degree, which does not depend on the choice of a monomial order. The method is similar to certain MutantXL algorithms, but our abstract formulation has advantages. For example, we can prove that the cryptographic systems multi-HFE and HFE are insecure.More generally, let k be a finite field of cardinality qn and let k' be the subfield of cardinality q. Let F⊂k[X0,...,Xm-1] be a finite subset generating a zero-dimensional ideal. We give an upper bound of the last fall degree of the Weil descent system of F from k to k', which depends on q, m, the last fall degree of F, the degree of F and the number of solutions of F, but not on n. This shows that such Weil descent systems can be solved efficiently if n grows and the other parameters are fixed. In particular, one can apply these results to show a weakness in the cryptographic protocols HFE and multi-HFE.},

abstract = {Multiplicity of equilibria is a prevalent problem in many economic models. Often equilibria are characterized as solutions to a system of polynomial equations. This paper gives an introduction to the application of Gr{\"{o}}bner bases for finding all solutions of a polynomial system. The Shape Lemma, a key result from algebraic geometry, states under mild assumptions that a given equilibrium system has the same solution set as a much simpler triangular system. Essentially, the computation of all solutions then reduces to finding all roots of a single polynomial in a single unknown. The software package Singular computes the equivalent simple system. If all coefficients in the original equilibrium equations are rational numbers or parameters, then the Gr{\"{o}}bner basis computations of Singular are exact. Thus, Gr{\"{o}}bner basis methods cannot only be used for a numerical approximation of equilibria, but in fact may allow the proof of theoretical results for the underlying economic model. Three economic applications illustrate that without much prior knowledge of algebraic geometry, Gr{\"{o}}bner basis methods can be easily applied to gain interesting insights into many modern economic models.},

In practice, however, most LP software provides misleading sensitivity information if the optimal solution is degenerate. The paper shows how sensitivity analysis of LP problems can be done correctly when the optimal solution is degenerate. A production planning example is presented to illustrate the incorrect sensitivity analysis results automatically provided by most LP solvers. The general characteristics of the misleading results and the possible effects of this incorrect information on management decisions are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The “XL-algorithm” is a computational method to solve overdetermined systems of polynomial equations which is based on a generalization of the well-known method of linearization; it was introduced to cryptology at Eurocrypt 2000. In this paper, we prove upper bounds on the dimensions of the spaces of equations in the XL-algorithm. These upper bounds provide strong evidence that for any fixed finite field K and any fixed c $\epsilon$ ℕ the median of the running times of the original XL-algorithm applied to systems of m = n + c quadratic equations in n variables over K which have a solution in K is not subexponential in n . In contrast to this, in the introduction of the original paper on XL, the authors claimed to “provide strong theoretical and practical evidence that the expected running time of this technique is [...] subexponential if m exceeds n by a small number”. More precise upper bounds on the dimensions of the spaces of equations in the XL-algorithm can be obtained if one assumes a standard conjecture from commutative algebra. We state the conjecture and discuss implications on the XL-algorithm.},

A standard tool to solve this problem consists of computing the Gr{\"{o}}bner bases of the corresponding ideals, and Faug{\`{e}}re's F4 and F5 are two well-known algorithms for this task. In this paper, we adapt the “Gr{\"{o}}bner trace” method of Traverso to the context of F4. The resulting variant is a heuristic algorithm, well suited to algebraic attacks of cryptosystems since it is designed to compute with high probability Gr{\"{o}}bner bases of a set of polynomial systems having the same shape. It is faster than F4 as it avoids all reductions to zero, but preserves its simplicity and its efficiency, thus competing with F5.},

abstract = {In spite of growing importance of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), the Data Encryption Standard (DES) is by no means obsolete. DES has never been broken from the practical point of view. The variant “triple DES” is believed very secure, is widely used, especially in the financial sector, and should remain so for many many years to come. In addition, some doubts have been risen whether its replacement AES is secure, given the extreme level of “algebraic vulnerability” of the AES S-boxes (their low I/O degree and exceptionally large number of quadratic I/O equations). Is DES secure from the point of view of algebraic cryptanalysis? We do not really hope to break it, but just to advance the field of cryptanalysis. At a first glance, DES seems to be a very poor target — as there is (apparently) no strong algebraic structure of any kind in DES. However in [5] it was shown that “small” S-boxes always have a low I/O degree (cubic for DES as we show below). In addition, due to their low gate count requirements, by introducing additional variables, we can always get an extremely sparse system of quadratic equations. To assess the algebraic vulnerabilities of DES is the easy part, that may appear unproductive. In this paper we demonstrate that in this way, several interesting attacks on a real-life “industrial” block cipher can be found. One of our attacks is the fastest known algebraic attack on 6 rounds of DES. It requires only one single known plaintext (instead of a very large quantity) which is quite interesting in itself. Our attacks will recover the key using an ordinary PC, for only six rounds. Furthermore, in a much weaker sense, we can also attack 12 rounds of DES. These results are very interesting because DES is known to be a very robust cipher, and our methods are very generic. We discuss how they can be applied to DES with modified S-boxes, and potentially other reduced-round block ciphers.},

A quantum algorithm for Hilbert's tenth problem, which is equivalent to the Turing halting problem and is known to be mathematically noncomputable, is proposed where quantum continuous variables and quantum adiabatic evolution are employed. If this algorithm could be physically implemented, as much as it is valid in principle-that is, if certain hamiltonian and its ground state can be physically constructed according to the proposal-quantum computability would surpass classical computability as delimited by the Church-Turing thesis. It is thus argued that computability, and with it the limits of Mathematics, ought to be determined not solely by Mathematics itself but also by Physical Principles.},

Euclid did just that and came up with the first pure creation. Relying on the common experience, he created an abstract world that had a life of its own. As the human knowledge progressed so did the ability of formulating and answering penetrating questions. In particular, mathematicians started wondering whether Euclid's “obvious” absolute postulates were indeed obvious and/or absolute. Scientists realized that Shape and Space are two closely related concepts and asked whether they really look the way our senses tell us. As Felix Klein pointed out in his Erlangen Program, there are many ways of looking at Shape and Space so that various points of view may produce different images. In particular, the most basic issue of “measuring the Shape” cannot have a clear cut answer. This is a book about Shape, Space and some particular ways of studying them.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the security of a public-key encryption scheme introduced by Huang, Liu and Yang (HLY) at PKC'12. This new scheme can be provably reduced to the hardness of solving a set of quadratic equations whose coefficients of highest degree are chosen according to a discrete Gaussian distributions. The other terms being chosen uniformly at random. Such a problem is a variant of the classical problem of solving a system of non-linear equations (PoSSo), which is known to be hard for random systems. The main hypothesis of Huang, Liu and Yang is that their variant is not easier than solving PoSSo for random instances. In this paper, we disprove this hypothesis. To this end, we exploit the fact that the new problem proposed by Huang, Liu and Yang reduces to an easy instance of the Learning With Errors (LWE) problem. The main contribution of this paper is to show that security and efficiency are essentially incompatible for the HLY proposal. That is, one cannot find parameters which yield a secure and a practical scheme. For instance, we estimate that a public-key of at least 1.03 $\backslash$textnormalGB is required to achieve 80-bit security against the simplest of our attacks. As a proof of concept, we present 3 practical attacks against all the parameters proposed by Huang, Liu and Yang. With the most efficient attack, we have been able to recover the private-key in roughly 5 minutes for the first challenge (i.e. Case 1) proposed by HLY and less than 30 minutes for the second challenge (i.e. Case2).},

abstract = {Given a zero-dimensional ideal I⊂K[x1,{\ldots},xn] of degree D, the transformation of the ordering of its Gr{\"{o}}bner basis from DRL to LEX is a key step in polynomial system solving and turns out to be the bottleneck of the whole solving process. Thus it is of crucial importance to design efficient algorithms to perform the change of ordering. The main contributions of this paper are several efficient methods for the change of ordering which take advantage of the sparsity of multiplication matrices in the classical FGLM algorithm. Combining all these methods, we propose a deterministic top-level algorithm that automatically detects which method to use depending on the input. As a by-product, we have a fast implementation that is able to handle ideals of degree over 60000. Such an implementation outperforms the MAGMA and SINGULAR ones, as shown by our experiments. First for the shape position case, two methods are designed based on the Wiedemann algorithm: the first is probabilistic and its complexity to complete the change of ordering is O(D(N1+nlog⁡(D)2)), where N1is the number of nonzero entries of a multiplication matrix; the other is deterministic and computes the LEX Gr{\"{o}}bner basis of I via Chinese Remainder Theorem. Then for the general case, the designed method is characterized by the Berlekamp–Massey–Sakata algorithm from Coding Theory to handle the multi-dimensional linearly recurring relations. Complexity analyses of all proposed methods are also provided. Furthermore, for generic polynomial systems, we present an explicit formula for the estimation of the sparsity of one main multiplication matrix, and prove that its construction is free. With the asymptotic analysis of such sparsity, we are able to show that for generic systems the complexity above becomes O(6/n$\pi$D2+n−1n).},

In particular, the results suggest that the "sugar flavor" of the "normal selection", implemented first in CoCoA, then in AlPI, and now in SCRATCHPAD-II, is the best choice for a selection strategy. It has to be combined with the "straight-forward" simplification strategy and with a special form of the Gebauer-M{\"{o}}ller criteria to obtain the best results. The idea of the "sugar flavor" is the following: the Buchberger algorithm for homogeneous ideals, with degree-compatible term ordering and normal selection strategy, usually works fine. Homogenizing the basis of the ideal is good for the strategy, but bad for the basis to be computed. The sugar flavor computes, for every polynomial in the course of the algorithm, "the degree that it would have if computed with the homogeneous algorithm", and uses this phantom degree (the sugar) only for the selection strategy. We have tested several examples with different selection strategies, and the sugar flavor has proved to be always the best choice or very near to it. The comparison between the different variants of the sugar flavor has been made, but the results are up to now inconclusive. We include a complete deterministic description of the Buchberger algorithm as it was used in our experiments.},

In this work, we investigate a recently-proposed strategy, the so-called "Mutant strategy", on which a new family of algorithms is based (MXL, MXL 2 and MXL 3). By studying and describing the algorithms based on Gr??bner basis concepts, we demonstrate that the Mutant strategy can be understood to be equivalent to the classical Normal Selection Strategy currently used in Gr??bner basis algorithms. Furthermore, we show that the "partial enlargement" technique can be understood as a strategy for restricting the number of S-polynomials considered in an iteration of the F 4 Gr??bner basis algorithm, while the new termination criterion used in MXL 3 does not lead to termination at a lower degree than the classical Gebauer-M??ller installation of Buchberger's criteria. We claim that our results map all novel concepts from the MXL family of algorithms to their well-known Gr??bner basis equivalents. Using previous results that had shown the relation between the original XL algorithm and F 4, we conclude that the MXL family of algorithms can be fundamentally reduced to redundant variants of F 4. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Amadori2018,
abstract = {In recent years several papers have appeared that investigate the classical discrete logarithm problem for elliptic curves by means of the multivariate polynomial approach based on the celebrated summation polynomials, introduced by Semaev in 2004. With a notable exception by Petit et al. in 2016, all numerous papers on the subject have investigated only the composite-field case, leaving apart the laborious prime-field case. In this paper we propose a variation of Semaev's original approach that reduces to only one the relations to be found among points of the factor base, thus decreasing drastically the necessary Groebner basis computations. Our proposal holds for any finite field but it is particularly suitable for the prime-field case, where it outperforms both the original Semaev's method and the specialised algorithm by Petit et al.},

abstract = {In 1965 Buchberger introduced an algorithmic approach to compute Gr{\"{o}}bner bases. Later on, he and many others presented various attempts to improve the computation by removing useless elements a priori. One approach, initiated by Gebauer, M{\"{o}}ller, Mora and Traverso in the 1990s, is to keep track of the corresponding syzygies which is related to the topic of this survey: signature-based algorithms for Gr{\"{o}}bner bases. This area was initiated by Faug{\`{e}}re's F5 algorithm in 2002. The general idea of signatures is to keep track of the history of the computation with a minimal overhead and to exploit this information to detect redundant elements. Here we give a summary of the literature on signature-based algorithms and show how to classify known algorithms by 3 different orderings. For this we give translations between different notations and show the relationships (differences and similarities) among many approaches. Moreover, we give a general description of how the idea of signatures is quite natural when performing the reduction process using linear algebra. We hope that this survey would help to outline this field of active research.},

In particular, our attack can solve an elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem defined over Fq3 in heuristic asymptotic running time over(O, ̃) (q4 / 3); and an elliptic problem over Fq4 or a genus 2 problem over Fq2 in heuristic asymptotic running time over(O, ̃) (q3 / 2). {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Fukuda2004,
abstract = {A zonotope is the Minkowski addition of line segments in Rd. The zonotope construction problem is to list all extreme points of a zonotope given by its line segments. By duality, it is equivalent to the arrangement construction problem-that is, to generate all regions of an arrangement of hyperplanes.By replacing line segments with convex V-polytopes, we obtain a natural generalization of the zonotope construction problem: the construction of the Minkowski addition of k polytopes. Gritzmann and Sturmfels studied this general problem in various aspects and presented polynomial algorithms for the problem when one of the parameters k or d is fixed. The main objective of the present work is to introduce an efficient algorithm for variable d and k. Here we call an algorithm efficient or polynomial if it runs in time bounded by a polynomial function of both the input size and the output size. The algorithm is a natural extension of a known algorithm for the zonotope construction, based on linear programming and reverse search. It is compact, highly parallelizable and very easy to implement.This work has been motivated by the use of polyhedral computation for optimal tolerance determination in mechanical engineering. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
